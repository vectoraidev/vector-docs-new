## Data Architecture

### Multi-Source Integration
**Primary APIs (6+ sources):**
- EVA AI: Contract auditing and security analysis
- GoPlus: Multi-chain security and holder data
- Token Sniffer: Security analysis and malicious databases
- DexScreener: Real-time market data and enhanced information
- Etherscan Family: Contract verification and transaction data
- OpenAI: AI-powered contract analysis and assistance

### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Input → Validation → Parallel API Calls → Data Normalization → 
Feature Analysis → Grade Calculation → Card Generation → Response
```

### Error Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Analysis continues with available data sources
- **Fallback Hierarchies**: Primary, secondary, and tertiary data sources
- **Partial Analysis**: Meaningful results even with limited data
- **Error Categorization**: Different handling for temporary vs permanent failures

## Analysis Engine

### Feature Weight System
```python
Security Analysis: 2.0x weight (most critical)
Holder Analysis: 1.5x weight (whale concentration risk)
Wash Trading Analysis: 1.3x weight (manipulation detection)
Market Analysis: 1.0x weight (liquidity and trading)
Sniper Analysis: 1.0x weight (launch patterns)
Link Analysis: 0.5x weight (informational)
```

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Base Score Calculation**: Individual feature scoring (0-100)
- **Risk Factor Application**: Negative adjustments for identified risks
- **Positive Factor Bonuses**: Rewards for good indicators
- **Weighted Combination**: Feature scores combined using weight system
- **Grade Assignment**: Numerical score converted to A+ through F grades

### Pattern Detection Algorithms
- **Wash Trading Detection**: Custom algorithms for trading pattern analysis
- **Holder Concentration Analysis**: Whale detection and risk assessment
- **Contract Risk Assessment**: Security vulnerability identification
- **Market Manipulation Detection**: Volume and price pattern analysis

## Visual Generation System

### Scoring Card Engine
- **Template System**: Multiple card templates based on scores
- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Real-time card creation with current data

- **Color Psychology**: Risk-appropriate color coding throughout
- **Brand Consistency**: Vector AI branding and styling standards

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Extraction**: Token info, grades, market data compilation
2. **Template Selection**: Appropriate template based on overall score
3. **Dynamic Composition**: Text and visual element positioning
4. **Logo Integration**: Automatic token logo fetching and processing
5. **Quality Assurance**: Final image optimization and validation
