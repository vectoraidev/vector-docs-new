## ðŸ§  Conversational AI Architecture

### **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user goals and required actions
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracts relevant information (addresses, tokens, amounts)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation history and user preferences
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Clarifies unclear requests through follow-up questions

### **Dialogue Management**
- **State Tracking**: Monitors conversation flow and current context
- **Response Planning**: Determines optimal response structure and content
- **Multi-Turn Handling**: Manages complex conversations across multiple exchanges
- **Personalization**: Adapts responses based on user history and preferences

### **Response Generation**
- **Dynamic Content**: Generates contextually relevant responses
- **Multi-Modal Output**: Combines text, charts, and interactive elements
- **Structured Formatting**: Presents information in easily digestible formats
- **Action Suggestions**: Provides specific recommendations and next steps

## ðŸ”„ Execution Flow

### **1. Query Processing**
```
User Input â†’ Intent Analysis â†’ Entity Extraction â†’ Context Loading
```

**Process Steps:**
- Parse natural language input
- Identify query type (analysis, transaction, information)
- Extract relevant entities (contracts, wallets, tokens)
- Load conversation context and user preferences

### **2. Data Orchestration**
```
Query Analysis â†’ Resource Planning â†’ Parallel Execution â†’ Data Aggregation
```

**Execution Strategy:**
- Determine required data sources and APIs
- Plan optimal execution sequence
- Execute multiple data requests in parallel
- Aggregate and validate collected information

### **3. AI Analysis**
```
Raw Data â†’ Model Selection â†’ Processing â†’ Insight Generation
```

**Analysis Pipeline:**
- Select appropriate AI models for data type
- Process information through specialized models
- Generate insights and identify patterns
- Assess risks and opportunities

### **4. Response Synthesis**
```
Analysis Results â†’ Response Planning â†’ Content Generation â†’ Delivery
```

**Response Creation:**
- Structure findings into coherent response
- Generate visualizations and charts
- Format for optimal readability
- Deliver through appropriate channel

## ðŸ’¬ Conversation Management

### **Context Awareness**
- **Session Memory**: Remembers conversation history within sessions
- **User Profiles**: Maintains long-term user preferences and history
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Synchronizes context across web and Telegram
- **Smart Defaults**: Uses context to pre-fill common parameters

### **Multi-Turn Conversations**
```
User: "Analyze PEPE token"
vGPT: [Provides comprehensive analysis]
User: "What about its liquidity?"
vGPT: [Focuses on liquidity metrics from previous analysis]
User: "Compare it to SHIB"
vGPT: [Comparative analysis using both tokens]
```

### **Follow-Up Handling**
- **Reference Resolution**: Understands pronouns and references
- **Topic Continuation**: Maintains focus on current analysis subject
- **Context Switching**: Smoothly transitions between different topics
- **Clarification Requests**: Asks for clarification when needed
